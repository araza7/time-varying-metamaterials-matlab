"Loss compensation in time-dependent elastic metamaterials"

Daniel Torrent, William J. Parnell, and Andrew N. Norris

Physical Review B 97, 014105 (2018)

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevB.97.014105

**Overview**

This code reproduces the key findings of the paper, demonstrating how temporal modulation of material properties (stiffness and density) can create a parametric gain mechanism that exactly compensates for intrinsic viscous losses in elastic media.
Features

•	Figure 3 Reproduction: Generates dispersion relations and calculates the stability parameter $\Delta(k_0)$ to identify regimes of dissipation, gain, and loss compensation.

•	Figure 4 Reproduction: Computes the total energy gain/loss of waves after $N$ modulation periods using transfer matrix theory.

•	Figure 5 Animation: Simulates the time-domain evolution of a Gaussian pulse, visualizing wave amplification and splitting inside the time-modulated medium.

Usage

Run the main script main.m (or whatever you name your file) in MATLAB. No external toolboxes are required.
